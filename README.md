:package: Package `tablexlsx` <img src="man/figures/hex_tablexlsx.png" width=110 align="right"/>
======================================

R package that allows to export data frames from R to xslx workbooks.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("ddotta/tablexlsx")
```

``` r
library(tablexlsx)
```

## Why this package ?

This package is a  wrapper of some functions from the great [openxlsx](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx) package.  

The purpose of this package is to meet the needs of R users who want to export data frames in `xlsx` files to share their data and results with other users not necessarily R users.  

The goal is to get an API that is as simple as possible to use. **It's intended to meet the needs of users who want to create clean, well-documented `xlsx` files (with a title and footnotes)**.  

The package will be improved over time and will include new features based on the needs expressed by users. To do so, feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/ddotta/tablexlsx/issues). 

## Advantages

Some advantages of using this package :  

- A simpler syntax for common export operations of excel files;  
- It can write several data frames in the same sheet one below the other;  
- It can merge modalities for one or several columns;  
- It can automatically open files as soon as they are created so you can inspect your workbook. 
- Data frames to be exported in `xlsx` files can be passed as an argument in functions as simple tables or list of tables.  
- The main function of the package [toxlsx()](https://ddotta.github.io/tablexlsx/reference/toxlsx.html) works interchangeably with `%>%` and `|>` operators and these 3 syntaxes below are equivalent :  

  
```
toxlsx(object = iris, path = mypath)
iris |> toxlsx(path = mypath)
iris %>% toxlsx(path = mypath)
```
