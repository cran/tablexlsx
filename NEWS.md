# tablexlsx 1.0.0

This release includes :

* `add_table()` and `toxlsx()` now accept a `bygroup` argument that splits the table into groups before writing to the sheet #23
* most arguments to `add_table()` and `toxlsx()` can now be passed as atomic vectors. If the first argument is a single `data.frame`, the behavior is the same as for a lenght-one list. If the first argument is a list of `data.frame`s, those arguments are recycled in order to match the length of the list. This change applies to the arguments `tosheet`, `title`, `footnoteX`, `mergecol`, `bygroup`, `groupname` #19
* when a list is passed to `toxlsx()`, the `mergecol` argument can now be specified for each data.frame of the list #21
* `asTable` argument is now set to FALSE in functions `add_table()` and `toxlsx()` #24
* Slight changes to API in order to solve #16 and #21
